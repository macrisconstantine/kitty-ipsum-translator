# kitty-ipsum-translator
Not much to see here
- Various little practice text and other files output while practicing bash.
- A couple 'kitty ipsum' text files which contain narrative from the perspective of a cat.
- A bash script of a couple lines to translate 'kitty ipsum' to 'doggy ipsum'.
- The doggy ipsum text files as output.
- This translator works by passing another text file as an argument to the translate.sh file, which pipes this argument into a sed command which replaces cat related words with dog related words. 
- The output is then piped into an output file.
